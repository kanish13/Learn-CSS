What is a Media Query?

Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.

It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

Example

If the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background color will be lightblue:

    @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
      body {
        background-color: lightblue;
      }
    }
