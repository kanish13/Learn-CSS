Font Properties Challenge 1 - Change the Colours [ You can use any color ]

CHALLENGE: Set the text colour for the h1 and h2 to both be the colour with hex code: #66BFBF

NOTE: In the last lesson, we changed the "a programmer" part to be an h2 tag. Check your code and make sure you've got the same.

CHALLENGE: Set the text colour for the h3 and anchor tag to be the colour with hex code #11999E

NOTE: Don't worry about the layout, background colour or alignment for now, we'll address that later. We're only interested in changing the font colours for this particular challenge.
